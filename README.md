# Biomechanics-Data-Visualization
This repository contains scripts for visualizing 3D biomechanical positional data. These scripts provide the logic for a visualization application developed in Unity as part of an NSF REU at the University of Minnesota. The below research poster provides images and descriptions of the visualization application and its uses.
